🎓 I am a third year Computer Science student at John Abbott College. (Hopefully my last year if all goes well 😉)

⛵ My hobbies include sailing which I have done for the past 11 years including as a coach. 
    Some other less hardcore hobbies are playing the guitar and playing video games.

📱 A project that I am currently working on is converting one of my already created projects into a cross platform mobile app.
