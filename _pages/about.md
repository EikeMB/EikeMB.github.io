üéì I am a third year Computer Science student at John Abbott College. (Hopefully my last year if all goes well :wink: )

‚õµ My hobbies include sailing which I have done for the past 11 years including as a coach. 
    Some other less hardcore hobbies are playing the guitar and playing video games.

üì± A project that I am currently working on is converting one of my already created projects into a cross platform mobile app.
