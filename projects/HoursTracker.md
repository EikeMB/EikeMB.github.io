## App Description

A windows desktop app that allows the user to add and track hours they have worked. 

The inspiration to create this application came when at my summer job there was no good way to keep track of hours as there was no clocking in method used. 

This project was more of a proof of concept for me to see if I should spend time making it into a mobile app.

## Technologies used

This app makes use of C# WPF and SQL for the database connections.
